## Source Code Organization
- Source files should be organized by feature or module
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use consistent naming conventions across the project
- Group related functionality together

## File Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, meaningful names
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood
- Include file extensions appropriate to the technology stack

## Directory Guidelines
- Keep directory structures shallow when possible
- Use clear, descriptive directory names
- Separate source code, tests, and documentation
- Maintain consistent structure across similar components

## Configuration Files
- Keep configuration files at appropriate levels (root, module, etc.)
- Use environment-specific configurations when needed
- Document configuration options and their purposes
- Follow security best practices for sensitive configuration
